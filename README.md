# GA WDI 30 Project 1

For the first project of WDI 30 we were set the task of bulding a game by applying what we had been taught during our first 2 weeks at General Assembly, namely:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* JQuery

The inspiration for the game came from an iPhone game called RE-TRACE and my aim was to recreate the overall feel and gameplay but with my own take on how it should be styled.
