# GA WDI 30 Project 1

For the first project of WDI 30 we were set the task of bulding a game by applying what we had been taught during our first 2 weeks at General Assembly, namely:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* JQuery

***

The inspiration for the game came from an iPhone game called 'RE-TRACE' and my aim was to recreate the overall feel and gameplay but with my own take on how it should be styled.

***

Once the game starts, a grid containing 16 tiles will appear and a random pattern will be displayed.  Once the pattern clears, the user will then need to repeat the pattern.  On each subsequent level, an additinal tile will be added to the length of the pattern.  

We were given one week to complete the project and I found it to both enjoyable and rewarding to be able to put the skills I had learned into practice.  

***

Overall, I am very pleased with how the project turned out given the time that was available to complete it.

Given more time, I would implement the following additonal features:

* Additional grid sizes, starting at 2x2 for level one and increasing to 5x5;
* A clearer way to display that the user has lost a life, in addition to just reducing the counter;
* A footer that sticks to the bottom of the page, regardless of the display size.
